SageMath and Python code for the paper "Hyperelliptic Curves and Newform Coefficients," by Spencer Dembner and Vanshika Jain. 

* The file perfect_powers_bound.sage contains the SageMath code used to derive bounds in the proof of Theorem 4.6. It is a modification of the file [H-plus-minus.sage](https://github.com/jbalakrishnan/Lehmer/blob/master/newforms/H-plus-minus.sage "H-plus-minus.sage") used by Jennifer S. Balakrishnan, William Craig, Ken Ono, and Wei-Lun Tsai in "Variants of Lehmer's speculation for newforms."
* The file elementary_sieve.py contains the Python code used to prove Theorem 3.3. Requires the file pisano_period.txt to be in the same directory to run. 
* The file checking_thue_upto_bounds.sage contains the SageMath code used to prove Lemma 4.8.
